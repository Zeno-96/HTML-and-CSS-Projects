        <p align="center">Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this? <br>
            People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this <br>
            They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets <br>
            Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line <br>
            It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy <br>
            Who takes every moment he knows he confided in <br>
            Music to use it for others to use it <br>
            You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this? <br>
            Life is up here but you comment below <br>
            And the comments will always become common <br>
            Motivation to promote your show's next episode <br>
            So your brain knows to keep going even though hope <br>
            Is far from this moment <br>
            But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head <br>
            Together we're losers, remember the future <br>
            Remember the morning is when night is dead</p>
